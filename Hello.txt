Hello 
I'm Florie Gosseau,
I consider myself as a data scientist. I have a phd in introgression of genomic data into crop model. 
I mainly work with regressive and linear models. Since the end of my college, I haven't work with Python (mainly R and matlab). 
With this formation I want to take in hand ML models and gain experience with python.
