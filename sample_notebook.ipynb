       "===========================\n",
       "\n",
       "The magic function system provides a series of functions which allow you to\n",
       "control the behavior of IPython itself, plus a lot of system-type\n",
       "features. There are two kinds of magics, line-oriented and cell-oriented.\n",
       "\n",
       "Line magics are prefixed with the % character and work much like OS\n",
       "command-line calls: they get as an argument the rest of the line, where\n",
       "arguments are passed without parentheses or quotes.  For example, this will\n",
       "time the given statement::\n",
       "\n",
       "        %timeit range(1000)\n",
       "\n",
       "Cell magics are prefixed with a double %%, and they are functions that get as\n",
       "an argument not only the rest of the line, but also the lines below it in a\n",
       "separate argument.  These magics are called with two arguments: the rest of the\n",
       "call line and the body of the cell, consisting of the lines below the first.\n",
       "For example::\n",
       "\n",
       "        %%timeit x = numpy.random.randn((100, 100))\n",
       "        numpy.linalg.svd(x)\n",
       "\n",
       "will time the execution of the numpy svd routine, running the assignment of x\n",
       "as part of the setup phase, which is not timed.\n",
       "\n",
       "In a line-oriented client (the terminal or Qt console IPython), starting a new\n",
       "input with %% will automatically enter cell mode, and IPython will continue\n",
       "reading input until a blank line is given.  In the notebook, simply type the\n",
       "whole cell as one entity, but keep in mind that the %% escape can only be at\n",
       "the very start of the cell.\n",
       "\n",
       "NOTE: If you have 'automagic' enabled (via the command line option or with the\n",
       "%automagic function), you don't need to type in the % explicitly for line\n",
       "magics; cell magics always require an explicit '%%' escape.  By default,\n",
       "IPython ships with automagic on, so you should only rarely need the % escape.\n",
       "\n",
       "Example: typing '%cd mydir' (without the quotes) changes your working directory\n",
       "to 'mydir', if it exists.\n",
       "\n",
       "For a list of the available magic functions, use %lsmagic. For a description\n",
       "of any of them, type %magic_name?, e.g. '%cd?'.\n",
       "\n",
       "Currently the magic system has the following functions:\n",
       "%alias:\n",
       "    Define an alias for a system command.\n",
       "    \n",
       "    '%alias alias_name cmd' defines 'alias_name' as an alias for 'cmd'\n",
       "    \n",
       "    Then, typing 'alias_name params' will execute the system command 'cmd\n",
       "    params' (from your underlying operating system).\n",
       "    \n",
       "    Aliases have lower precedence than magic functions and Python normal\n",
       "    variables, so if 'foo' is both a Python variable and an alias, the\n",
       "    alias can not be executed until 'del foo' removes the Python variable.\n",
       "    \n",
       "    You can use the %l specifier in an alias definition to represent the\n",
       "    whole line when the alias is called.  For example::\n",
       "    \n",
       "      In [2]: alias bracket echo \"Input in brackets: <%l>\"\n",
       "      In [3]: bracket hello world\n",
       "      Input in brackets: <hello world>\n",
       "    \n",
       "    You can also define aliases with parameters using %s specifiers (one\n",
       "    per parameter)::\n",
       "    \n",
       "      In [1]: alias parts echo first %s second %s\n",
       "      In [2]: %parts A B\n",
       "      first A second B\n",
       "      In [3]: %parts A\n",
       "      Incorrect number of arguments: 2 expected.\n",
       "      parts is an alias to: 'echo first %s second %s'\n",
       "    \n",
       "    Note that %l and %s are mutually exclusive.  You can only use one or\n",
       "    the other in your aliases.\n",
       "    \n",
       "    Aliases expand Python variables just like system calls using ! or !!\n",
       "    do: all expressions prefixed with '$' get expanded.  For details of\n",
       "    the semantic rules, see PEP-215:\n",
